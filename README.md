# Survey-of-Consumer-Finances-Scatter
I chose these two variable because they are closely realetd and both are some what depended on each other. As we become older, we gain more work experince and this allows us to move up the finical ladder. So as the age of household leader increases, the income of the household should incerase too. There could be some other variable that effect the data, such as other mebers of the household. The age variable only acounts for the leader of the hosuehold, so if someone else who live in the houseold who is younger and makes more will effect the income of the household but not contriube to the age. The data is very interesting. It shows that a majority of people make the most amount of money later in life, near their 70's. There are a couple of outliers.
